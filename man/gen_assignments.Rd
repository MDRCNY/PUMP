\usage{
gen_assignments(J, K, nbar)
}
\arguments{
\item{J}{scalar; number of schools per district.}

\item{K}{scalar; number of districts.}

\item{nbar}{scalar; number of individuals per school.}
}
\value{
list; school and district

\description{
Generates simple default schools and 
districts IDs for individual students for the purpose of
simulations. This assumes equal sized schools in 
equal sized districts.

This function is beyond the main scope of calculating power,
and is instead used for simulating data.
For more info on use, see the simulation vignette.
