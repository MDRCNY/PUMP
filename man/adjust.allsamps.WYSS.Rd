\title{WestFallYoung Single Step Adjustment Function}
\usage{
adjust.allsamps.WYSS(snum, abs.Zs.H0, abs.Zs.H1)
}
\arguments{
\item{snum}{the number of samples for which test statistics under the alternative hypothesis
are compared with the distribution (matrix) of test statistics under the complete null (this distribution
is obtained through drawing test values under H0 with a default of 10,000)}

\item{abs.Zs.H0}{a matrix of test statistics under the complete null}

\item{abs.Zs.H1}{a matrix of raw test statistics under the alternative}
}
\value{
a matrix of adjusted test statistics values
}
\description{
This adjustment function utilizes the comp.rawt.SS helper function to compare
each row of the matrix sample test statistics under
alternative hypothesis to all the rows in the matrix of the test statistics under the complete null (i.e think a distribution).
Furthermore, it carries out the comparison for all the samples of raw test statistics under the alternative.
